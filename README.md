##What Zibaldone does


Zibaldone uses chunks of markdown text, called **fragments**, to create html books.

Zibaldone can handle multiple books and each can contain any number of fragments.<br/>

Zibaldone is compatible with [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com) and this means that the books can be automatically rendered as ebooks (pdf, epub, mobi) and that you can sell, publish, share them right away.

The fragments are alway text files living on your computer but they can be originated from remote **references**.

A reference is, well, a reference :-) It points to any markdown file living in an external resource (for now only Github).

When reference is added to a book its content is downloaded and saved in local fragment which can be modified as you like.

Through the graphic interface the fragments can be drag and drop to change their order sequence while the paragraphs dependency is set by indenting them.

Both the order and the paragraphs dependency will be reflected in the index menu in the html book.


##A bit of history

> Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book#Zibaldone)

> During the course of the 15th century, the Italian peninsula was the site of a development of two new forms of book production: the deluxe registry book and the zibaldone (or hodgepodge book). What differentiated these two forms was their language of composition: a vernacular. Giovanni Rucellai, the compiler of one of the most sophisticated examples of the genre, defined it as a "salad of many herbs.

> Zibaldone were always paper codices of small or medium format – never the large desk copies of registry books or other display texts. [..] Devotional, technical, documentary and literary texts appear side-by-side in no discernible order.

> By the 17th century, commonplacing had become a recognized practice that was formally taught to college students in such institutions as Oxford. John Locke appended his indexing scheme for commonplace books to a printing of his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. [..] <b>“Commonplacing” persisted as a popular study technique until the early 20th century</b>.

Well, I wonder if it's not the right time to start using it again ...
After all we stand on the shoulders of giants, right? ;-)
