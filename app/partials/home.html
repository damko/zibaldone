            <h2>What Zibaldone does</h2>

            <p>
                Zibaldone uses chunks of markdown text, called <strong>fragments</strong>, to create html books.
            </p>

            <p>
                Zibaldone can handle multiple books and each can contain any number of fragments.<br/>
            </p>

            <p>
                Zibaldone is compatible with <a href="http://leanpub.com" target="_blank">Leanpub</a> and
                this means that the books can be automatically rendered as ebooks (pdf, epub, mobi) and that you can sell, publish, share them right away.
            </p>

            <p>
                The fragments are alway text files living on your computer but they can be originated from remote <strong>references</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A reference is, well, a reference :-) It points to any markdown file living in an external resource (for now only Github).
            </p>

            <p>
                When reference is added to a book its content is downloaded and saved in local fragment which can be modified as you like.
            </p>

            <p>
                The fragments can be sorted using the graphic interface. By drag and dropping the fragment you change their order while by indenting them you set the paragraphs dependency.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both the order and the paragraphs dependency will be reflected in the index menu in the html book.

        <h2>A bit of history</h2>

            <p>During the course of the 15th century, the Italian peninsula was the site of a development of two new forms of book production: the deluxe registry book and the zibaldone (or hodgepodge book). What differentiated these two forms was their language of composition: a vernacular. Giovanni Rucellai, the compiler of one of the most sophisticated examples of the genre, defined it as a "salad of many herbs.
            </p>

            <p>Zibaldone were always paper codices of small or medium format – never the large desk copies of registry books or other display texts. [..] Devotional, technical, documentary and literary texts appear side-by-side in no discernible order.
            </p>

            <p>
            By the 17th century, commonplacing had become a recognized practice that was formally taught to college students in such institutions as Oxford. John Locke appended his indexing scheme for commonplace books to a printing of his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. [..] <b>“Commonplacing” persisted as a popular study technique until the early 20th century</b>.

            Well, I wonder if it's not the right time to start using it again ... <br/>
            After all we stand on the shoulders of giants, right? ;-)
